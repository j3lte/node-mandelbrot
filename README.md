## node-madelbrot

Just my first NodeJS app ever committed to Github. It's an example app that produces
[Mandelbrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) images. It uses the canvas
module to produce it server-side.

This code needs to be optimized in the future, now it is slow in generating it.

Start it with

```
node app.js
```

and open the page in the browser: http://localhost:3000
